        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Ooni Pizza Oven</strong> enables us to cook fresh, delicious pizza in under 2 minutes. With a gas connect line that hooks up to a propane tank, setup is easy and the flame from the back of the oven with our pizza stone can cook pizza (or anything in a skillet!) with ease - just make sure the oven is outside! The learning curve to cook our crust just right takes time, but once mastered the pizza output is next level.

            While there is no specific recipe I have followed, due to feel and trial and error I will provide my preparation and cooking steps to help make delicious pizza. Note there are no measurements for the ingredients, but as long as enough is provided to cover the pizza surface without overdoing it, it should be fine. I once saw on the Ooni Facebook Community page where someone said "Less is More". All we need is our oven, a propane tank, ingredients, and peel spatula.

            Some of my favorite ingredients, as well as easiest to use, comes from Trader Joes and Whole Foods. For these instructions, I will explain how to make one of my favorite pizzas in the oven - pepperoni, mushroom, and onion pizza on either a white garlic spread or red tomato sauce base.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trader Joes pizza dough</li>
            <li>Trader Joes garlic spread dip</li>
            <li>Your favorite shredded cheese(s) - mine are mozzarella, pepper jack, or Trader Joes toscano cheese</li>
            <li>Whole Foods pepperoni</li>
            <li>Mushrooms <em>(sliced)</em></li>
            <li>Red onion <em>(thinly sliced rings split in 1/4s or 1/5s)</em></li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pre-preparation:</strong> Remove pizza dough from the refrigerator (still in the wrapper) and let sit out for at least 2 hours to allow the dough to rise. After ~2 hours, feel the pizza dough to see if it is close to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Light the pizza oven. Ensure your propane tank is open and connected to the Ooni, and flip over the pizza stone to the clean side if haven't done so already. Carefully and slowly rotate the igniter for at leaset 5 seconds while the lighter fluid fills and spreads across the back of the oven. Stop once you hear the oven <em>click</em> and leave the heat on high for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                While the oven and pizza stone preheat, prepare our dough and ingredients.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Slice mushrooms in half and then sliced, or however you prefer to slice your mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Slice 1-2 rings of onions and cut them into even piece, slightly bigger than diced. I imagine a pie chart broken out into 6ths or 8ths depending on the size of the onion.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of flour on pizza peel. I like to do this over my cutting board used to spread my pizza dough, so the excess flour is added to my cutting board where I remove and spread the pizza dough on in the next step.</li>
                    <li>Take pizza dough out of its wrapper and place onto a bed of flour to ensure dough does not stick to your surface.</li>
                    <li>Cut the pizza dough in half so you may prepare 2 pizzas.</li>
                    <li>Add more flour to the top and side surfaces of one dough. Then, knead the dough until it is evenly flat and round.</li>
                    <li>Push and spread out pizza dough with your hands in outwards, circular motions. Continue until the center of the dough is nice and thin while the outer edges remain slightly thicker to develop an edge crust.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Spread a modest amount of sauce onto the entire bed of our pizza dough, with the exception of the thicker outer edge using a spoon or ladle.</li>
            <li>Add a base layer of cheese evenly distributed over our sauced dough, enough to cover but still be able to see some of the sauce underneath.</li>
            <li>Add enough toppings in any order desired, evenly distributed, enough to cover but still be able to see the cheese and sauce underneath. My preferred order goes mushrooms first, then pepperoni, and finally the onions.</li>
            <li>Add more cheese as desired to cover ingredients and create a golden brown cheese topping.</li>
            <li>If 15-20 minutes has passed since turning on the oven, carefully slide pizza peel underneath our pizza entirely. Bring over to the Ooni pizza oven.</li>
            <li>Turn oven heat down to low.</li>
            <li>Slide and wiggle the pizza off of the peel and flat onto the pizza stone in the oven, such that the shape of our pizza becomes round again. <strong><em>This is the only time to correct for the crust misshaping during launch, while the dough is still soft</em></strong>.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza cook for <strong>35 seconds</strong>. You should hear the cheese and ingredients start to sizzle, while the dough begins to rise.</li>
            <li>Using our peel, slide under our pizza and rotate 180 degrees. <strong><em>Note: the crust closest to the flame has cooked more than at the opening of the oven, so we need to have the back and front ends balance out first before cooking the left and right sides</em></strong>.</li>
            <li>Slide pizza back into the oven to cook for <strong>30 seconds</strong>. Again, the ingredients and cheese will sizzle while the crust underneath rises.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza and rotate the pizza 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>Slide pizza back into the oven to cook for <strong>15 seconds</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza and rotate the pizza 180 degrees.</li>
            <li>Slide pizza back into the oven to cook for<strong>15 seconds</strong>. By this time, all 4 sides of the pizza will have been closest to the flame.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza from the oven. If cooking more pizzas, turn heat back onto high to bring back up to heat while the next pizza is prepared, using the same or similar steps done previously. If done, let the oven remain on high heat for ~5 minutes to burn away any excess flour or dropped ingredients before shutting off the heat and closing the gas.</li>
            <li>Slide pizza onto a fresh plate or cutting board. Let stand for a quick minute before slicing into desired number of slices. Enjoy!</li>
